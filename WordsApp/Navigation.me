Android Jetpack provides Navigation Component to handle any navigation implementation.
The navigation component has 3 key parts which we'll use to implement navigation in this app.
the first part is: Navigation Graph -> the navigation graph is an XML file that provides a visual
representation of navigation in your app. the file consists of destinations which correspond of
individual activities and fragments as well as actions between them which can be used in code to
navigate from one destination to another.
